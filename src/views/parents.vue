                            Esports means electronic sports aka. Computer Games but these games are brought to another 
                            competitive level which involves both physical and in-game training. If you have the required 
                            skill set you can participate in tournaments and championships. Esports is for everyone
                            regardless of age or language. But you are not sitting in front of the computer the whole time.
                            In order to be a high-level performer in every sport there is a lot of training both digital and phiysical.
                            Most of the professional eSport players are in good shape because it helps them improve their reactions and 
                            it allows them to think more clearly.

                            We have a strong no-swearing policy which we strictly follow. No one is allowed to swear or 
                            use any offensive words. Breaking these rules results in physical training as punishment.

                            It will stay and the reson for this is that it pulls people out of their otherwise lonely existance
                            of sitting infront of a computer. Esports help create a community where gamers can socialize and share
                            their experiences with other people who can relate. It also creates a common point of interest for
                            gamers who play following the same principles so that makes socializing as easy as it is in other 
                            sports like football, volleyball etc.
